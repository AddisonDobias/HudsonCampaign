			BLADES

- Nebulan Blade: A thorough study and papers on feel, balance of the blade. Pictures of contstruction etc...

The Nebulan blade is made of an interesting material. Seeing tons of weaponry in my life through The Order, I have never seen a weirder material than this. It's forging technique is completely foreign to me and seeing how nebulan magic can actually change the shape and sharpness of the blade, how to quench and reworking the material, its qualities and its properties are foreign to me as well. The material seems to have an odd balancing quality, it cuts through the air with great ease and really anything for that matter. It cut through the nebulans magic stone as though it was butter even though my other well taken care of weaponry could not scratch it. 

The general construction of the blade is fairly standard for a high quality blade, it is a full tang blade (the knife portion extends into the handle and the ornaments fit on top of the 'tang'). It is white ceramic in color and the handle of the short sword is pitch black masterfully crafted and grafted onto the blade. Whether the blade was shaped magically or forged is beyond me. The material is something I would absolutely love to work with in the future, though as far as I know, it is only found on the now disappeared Islands of the North.

- Urthan's Blade: General pictures and drawings, notes on its contruction and diagrams but as for anything enchanting, it's beyond me


- Snake Fang Dagger x2 : After learning a little from Ansol, I learned that these early protoypes could potentially evolve into a full fledged weapon of destruction. While these current blades aren't tanged properly granting them plenty of structural integrity issues, Ansol did like the way I grafted the actual fang. Post this Ansol said that if I full tanged it, I could use the daggers as injection mechanisms to inject lethal poison.

- Eaglor Wing armor: Eaglor has a 15 wing span, with runic controllable material for eaglor, I could potentially graft armor on eaglors wings to make him a forward facing sheild. The risk of course would be that his front is exposed but with training, eaglor could protect himself with an armor of runic material. Tl;Dr Wings get armor so he can sheild people behind him.
